# MealHop: a lunch order coordinating bot for your office groupchat in Cisco Spark

Using the Cisco Spark sparkbot template, our team created a bot to coordinate lunch orders with the entire office.

First, add the bot (mealhop) to your group chat. 

Below are the commands that you can perform on the bot. Remember to @mealhop when messaging it since you are in a groupchat.

/help to get a list of commands
/setzipcode [zipcode] to set your location
/start [restaurant] [minutes to decide] 
/where to get the restaurant name 
/order [your order] to submit your order 
/editorder [your edited order] to change your order
/showorders to see the current order list 
/add [additional order] to add to your current order 
/deleteorder to delete your submitted order 
/cancel to cancel the entire order
